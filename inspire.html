  <h1> Who inspires me?</h1>
<p>Jesus the Nazareth</p>
<p>There are a lot of historical figures that are inspiring to me. However, one has had the biggest impact on my life. Whether you view Him as a wise teacher or Lord and Savior, I believe He has shaped my entire life and given me something to believe in. I live for Jesus, and am inspired every day to be more like Him. </p>
